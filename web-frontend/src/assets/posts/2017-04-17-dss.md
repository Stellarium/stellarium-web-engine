**Copyright notice:**

The Digitized Sky Surveys were produced at the Space Telescope Science
Institute under U.S. Government grant NAG W-2166. The images of these surveys
are based on photographic data obtained using the Oschin Schmidt Telescope on
Palomar Mountain and the UK Schmidt Telescope. The plates were processed into
the present compressed digital form with the permission of these institutions.

The National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Atlas (POSS-I) was
made by the California Institute of Technology with grants from the National
Geographic Society.

The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-II) was made by the California
Institute of Technology with funds from the National Science Foundation, the
National Geographic Society, the Sloan Foundation, the Samuel Oschin
Foundation, and the Eastman Kodak Corporation.

The Oschin Schmidt Telescope is operated by the California Institute of
Technology and Palomar Observatory.

The UK Schmidt Telescope was operated by the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, with
funding from the UK Science and Engineering Research Council (later the UK
Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council), until 1988 June, and
thereafter by the Anglo-Australian Observatory. The blue plates of the southern
Sky Atlas and its Equatorial Extension (together known as the SERC-J), as well
as the Equatorial Red (ER), and the Second Epoch [red] Survey (SES) were all
taken with the UK Schmidt. 

All data are subject to the copyright given in the [copyright summary].
Copyright information specific to individual plates is provided in the
downloaded FITS headers.

Supplemental funding for sky-survey work at the ST ScI is provided by the
European Southern Observatory.
