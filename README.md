Build the javascript version

You need to make sure you have both [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) and [sconstruct](https://pypi.org/project/SCons/) installed.

    # Setup emscripten path.
    source $PATH_TO_EMSDK/emsdk_env.sh

    # Build stellarium-web-engine.js and stellarium-web-engine.wasm
